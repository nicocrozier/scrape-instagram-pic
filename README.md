# Scrape Instagram Pictures
Scrape a single photo from Instagram and save to computer


I reccomend using a virtual enviorment.

Put file in the same folder as the venv, not as the bin & lib.

Ment to be use for a singulr Instagram pic not an entire profile.


<b>To Run</b>
- cd into the virtual enviorment folder.
- "python instascrape.py"
- Paste in picture URL.
  Example: https://www.instagram.com/p/CEMraD_nGYk/  <b>NOT</b> https://www.instagram.com/visualpleasuremag/
- Photo will save in the virtual env folder.
